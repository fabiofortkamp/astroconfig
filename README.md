## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

#### Make a backup of your current nvim and shared folder

```shell
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak

## Local configuration
Configuration you put under `lua/local.lua` is loaded, but this file is not under version control. Use this file to
add *local* configuration, or sensitive config that you do not want to share publicly.
